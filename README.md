# Movie-Trailers-Home

This is a  basic python project showing a webpage with a list of movie trailers, where users can click to  see a trailer of the 
movie


## Getting Started

To help you generate a website that displays these movies, I have  provided a starter code repository that contains a Python module called movie-trailer.py. To get started, fork this repository to create your own copy in GitHub.

### Prerequisites
Install python

I have used python 2.7 for the development.

## How to run the application.

$sudo python entertainment_center.py
